### Definition recognition ###

Python version: 3.11

Used packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- keras
- nltk

This is simple RNN which recognize if sentence is a definition. Dataset contains definitions and non-definitions from standford dictionary, wikipedia and fisma. Model is trained on all of those. 

--------------------------------------------
For now, I trained model on raw data, I mean without cleaning from stopwords, lemmatize and so on. 

But those is the next step of this aproach.
